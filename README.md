# Advent of Code 2021
My code for Advent of Code 2021.

The scripts used for house-keeping are in the scripts directory. The solutions directory contians the input and code.

## Running

To run these you must have python, bash, julia, and cargo on path. Use the command
```
bash scripts/run.sh [day number] [part number]
```
to run code from the solutions directory.
