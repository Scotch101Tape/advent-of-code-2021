# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions and code for Advent of Code 2021.

The scripts used for house keeping are in the scripts directory. The solutions directory contians the input, code, and solution for each day. Not every day may be filled, as I may not do some days.

## Replit 
The Replit environment that I used for running the code can be found [here](https://replit.com/@Scotch101Tape/advent-of-code-2021).
