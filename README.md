# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions and code for Advent of Code 2021.

The scripts used for house keeping are in the scripts directory. The solutions directory contians the input and code. Not every day may be filled, as I may not do some days.

## Running

To run these you must have python and bash available. Use the command
```
bash scripts/run.sh [day number] [part number]
```
to run code from solutions.
